Calculates gallons of gas needed and number of stops for a road trip.


Assignment:

You and your friends are planning a road trip. Write a program that asks the user for information about where they are going and the car they are driving and then gives them some helpful information about their trip. Specifically, you should ask the user for:
• the name of the city they are leaving from
• the name of the city they are going to
• the distance between the two cities
• how many miles per gallon their car gets
• how many gallons the car's gas tank holds
You should output the name of the starting and ending cities, the number of gallons of gas the trip requires (with one decimal place) and the number of stops you will need to make along the way (as an integer). Make sure the first letter of the city names are capitalized, even if the user didn't capitalize them. You may assume that your gas tank is full at the beginning of the trip.
